## üîó Using the OpenAI Bridge

### 1. Start your MCP Flask server

```bash
python mcp_plain_flask_app.py  # serves /mcp on :8080
```

### 2. Run the OpenAI Bridge

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
python mcp_openai_bridge.py   # serves /chat on :8090
```

### 3. Try a request

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8090/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":"What time is it in Asia/Kolkata and how many words in \"hello brave new world\"?"}'
